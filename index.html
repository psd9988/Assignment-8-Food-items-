  <h1> The Love of Food </h1><br><br>

  George Bernard Shaw once said “there is no sincerer love than the love of food.” Food and eating often bring with it a sense of community, a sense of happiness, and a sense of enjoyment. With eating though, comes many underlying social standards, that regardless of the situation, people try to follow. What to eat, where to sit, who to sit with, are all questions posed at every meal, and especially in a college environment, are questions that are quite important to how a person believes he or she is perceived. It was about 11:15 AM on a Thursday, and I was on my way to the Hecht-Stanford Dining Hall at the University of Miami. It was a beautiful September morning filled with sun, and although early for lunch, there were a fair share of people entering the hall. One must wait in line to swipe his or her cane-card, but the line to enter the dining hall was fairly short. While waiting on line, I could see two different types of people standing together; people who came in groups as well as several people who came to the hall by themselves.
